# This is a template for a Python scraper on Morph (https://morph.io)
# including some code snippets below that you should find helpful

import requests
import scraperwiki
import lxml.html
#
# # Read in a page
params = {
		'negeri': 'JOHOR',
		'preview_button': 'Papar',
	}
resp = requests.post('http://idengue.remotesensing.gov.my/idengue/lokaliti_wabakB.php')
#
# # Find something on the page using css selectors
root = lxml.html.fromstring(resp.content)
table = root.cssselect("#contentpaneopen *")
print table
#
# # Write out to the sqlite database using scraperwiki library
# scraperwiki.sqlite.save(unique_keys=['name'], data={"name": "susan", "occupation": "software developer"})
#
# # An arbitrary query against the database
# scraperwiki.sql.select("* from data where 'name'='peter'")

# You don't have to do things with the ScraperWiki and lxml libraries. You can use whatever libraries are installed
# on Morph for Python (https://github.com/openaustralia/morph-docker-python/blob/master/pip_requirements.txt) and all that matters
# is that your final data is written to an Sqlite database called data.sqlite in the current working directory which
# has at least a table called data.
